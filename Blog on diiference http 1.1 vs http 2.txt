Differnece between http 1.1 vs http 2

HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication. By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user. There are several stages of development of HTTP but we will focus mainly on HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.

HTTP 1.1

It works on the textual format.There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.It compresses data by itself.
The first response that a client receives on an HTTP GET request is often not the fully rendered page. Instead, it contains links to additional resources needed by the requested page.

HTTP 2

It works on the binary protocol.It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
It uses HPACK for data compression. In HTTP/2, the binary framing layer encodes requests/responses and cuts them up into smaller packets of information, greatly increasing the flexibility of data transfer.
