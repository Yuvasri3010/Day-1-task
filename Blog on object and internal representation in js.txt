	*For example: Person, car, pen, bike, Personal Computer , Washing Machine etc.

Take the case of cars.

	*All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car. All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.

The following code assigns many values (Mercedes, C-class, White and soo on) to a variable named Car:
var car = {Make: “Mercedes”, Model: “C-Class”, Color: “White”, Fuel: Diesel};

2)Object Properties
